# TABSlike
A python ASCII roguelike game inspired by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.

TABS is a semi-zero-player strategy game, where you don't *control* the units, but *place* them instead and watch them fight the enemy units. I decided to make my own game in that style, but that time, ASCII. Because why not? :)
I decided not to use much libraries and I try to make it work with mostly standard python tools.
